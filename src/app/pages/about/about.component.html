      <p>
        At <strong>Good Boy Brews</strong>, we believe in crafting beers that not only taste amazing, but bring people together.
        Whether you're a fan of hoppy IPAs, smooth lagers, or fruity ales — there's a brew here for every kind of beer lover.

      <p>
        What started as a small passion project turned into a community-driven brewery focused on creativity, quality, and a whole lot of personality.
        And yes, our mascot is a really good boy 🐶.
